VncSharp
--------

VncSharp is a Free and Open Source (GPL) implementation of the VNC Remote Framebuffer (RFB) Protocol for the .NET Framework. [VNC] (Virtual Network Computing) is a cross-platform client/server protocol allowing remote systems to be controlled over a network. VNC was originally developed at A
T&T Laboratories in Cambridge and is now being developed by RealVNC in the UK. You [can download] VNC clients and servers from RealVNC's website, or from a number of other parallel development projects.

VncSharp is a VNC Client Library and custom Windows Forms Control. VncSharp is also Free Software, released under the GPL. You can freely use VncSharp to bundle VNC functionality into your own .NET applications simply by dragging and dropping a control onto your form.

VncSharp was written by David Humphrey (david.humphrey@senecac.on.ca) with contributions from many others (see CHANGELOG).

Technical Details
-----------------

VncSharp is the best fully managed VNC control there is, and the code is now very mature. People around the world are using it in interesting ways (e.g., Terminals). What began in 2002 as a port of the Java client evolved into a complete rewrite to take advantage of both C#'s and the .NET Framework's strengths. VncSharp supports all known versions of the RFB Protocol from 3.3 onward, including 3.8. You can read more about how VncSharp was written and how you can use it on the Documentation page.
Contributing and the State of the Project

The code is now at a stable version 1.0.  The code is no longer actively maintained by me (David Humphrey), and has been put on github so others can continue the work if they desire.

VncSharp is licensed for use in open source applications. If you have an idea for another use and require a different license, let me know.
